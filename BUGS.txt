# BUGS

- saving Nginx.txt page cause a panic
- parsing of YAML header must be rewritten:

```
2014/08/27 10:38:13 page.go:133: <stdin>:1: (SEVERE/4) Title overline & underline mismatch.

####
Nginx
#####
Exiting due to level-4 (SEVERE) system message.
```

As you can see the first line of '###' is missing a character.
